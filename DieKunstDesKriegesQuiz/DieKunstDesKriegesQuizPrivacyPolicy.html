<h2>Die Kunst des Krieges Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The app wants to access for your identity, your
location and your media files on the phone. Actually
this permissions are not necessary to provide functionality
but a third party library added this requirements to the
manifest file. The permissions of an app are defined
in its manifest. When I include the third party library
(which is for the particles), the requirements of the
library are merged with my manifest and I cannot delete
them. This app does not use your location, your files
or your identity. The permissions are required without
beeing used because of the library. The network
permissions are necessary to display ads on your phone.
